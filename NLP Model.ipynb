       "       'Geoff Emerick - A Synaesthetic Genius of Sound at Work on Musical Masterpieces!<br /><br />Geoff Emerick was the \\\\\\\\\"Balance Engineer\\\\\\\\\" / Sound Recorder / Mixing Desk Console man at EMI\\'s Studios on Abbey Road in London, England who worked on all of The Beatles\\' records from Revolver till the end. He is a genius! ... The Beatles would absolutely NOT have gotten their records to SOUND as good as they did without him. Before him, their records sounded great - not only because people like George Martin and Norman Smith (their earlier sound man at the controls) were also perfectionists, but because - let\\'s face it - it was The Beatles! They are the greatest band in the world. Their music is majestic, magical, and timeless. Their lyrics, vocal harmonies, and rock energy are \\\\\\\\\"second to none!\\\\\\\\\" ... But before they got Geoff Emerick as their sound man, their outstanding music was still recorded very conventionally. It was perfect, precise, and pristine! ... After Geoff Emerick came on board (pun intended!), their sound became OUT OF THIS WORLD! It was he, and pretty much he alone, who created their third period \\\\\\\\\"psychedelic sound.\\\\\\\\\" This was no small feat!<br /><br />Geoff Emerick is a very humble man - but also nobody\\'s fool, and he\\'s an upstanding individual of very high principle. Also, he has a great sense of humor that lets you in on the fact that he never takes himself seriously. But he takes THE WORK at hand VERY seriously! I would trust him with my own sound recordings in a heartbeat! This man cares. ... His approach to sound recording is one of an artist, an enthusiast, and inspired and gifted co-producer of the work in progress. He is organized, detailed, meticulous, responsible, and highly adventurous, experimental, and inventive. He was the perfect man to record the music of The Beatles. It is no wonder that Sir Paul McCartney himself, very early on, saw the value of his character and the quality of his work and befriended him before any of the other Beatles even took notice. Paul is nobody\\'s fool, either! He and Mr. Emerick have had a great working relationship over the years, both before and after The Beatles broke up. Indeed, it is quite clear that they are also very good mates and the dearest of friends. Such shall it ever be!<br /><br />Geoff Emerick himself gives credit to all of the working sound technicians at Abbey Road who helped shape the sound of The Beatles over the years; people like: George Martin, Norman Smith, Richard Lush, Phil MacDonald, Malcolm Davies, Pete Brown, Ken Scott, John Smith, Alan Parsons, Ron Pender, Tony Clark, John Kurlander, and even Glyn Johns (who recorded Get Back, Let It Bleed, and Who\\'s Next - all masterpieces! - at Olympic Recording Studio and / or Twickenham Film Studios). Thankfully, he is not part of the chorus of people with praises for Phil Spector and his tsunamic wall of reverbed, overly echoed sound! Thank God! ... Geoff is not one to pull punches or refrain from telling it like it is. In fact, he\\'s probably one of the few people ever in the world to put The Beatles in their place when they were on their high horses and totally out of line, showing disrespect in the studio for George Martin as well as the other crew at Abbey Road at work on their sessions. Right in the middle of a recording session, he walked out on them! ... He had too much self respect to take their disrespectful attitudes any longer. He stood his ground - and it all worked out very well for him in the ensuing weeks and months and years because of it. I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for this man\\'s character as well as his work ethic - not even to mention his masterful synaesthetic sense of mixing the sound of music! The Beatles were very lucky to have him at the controls.<br /><br />Anyone who knows me knows that I love music more than anything. My first greatest love in the world is playing music live with other people; my second greatest love is creating and composing my own original music, and my third greatest love is recording the music that I and my other musician friends create and perform. Of course, just like anyone else, I love to listen to the music of the greatest artists in the world, like The Beatles, and knowing HOW that music was created in the studio by people like Geoff Emerick who worked together with them and was highly instrumental in helping to shape their sound is not only highly instructional and educational for a person like me who loves to record sound but also extremely enjoyable to say the least. I mean, this man practically, single-handedly created the Yamaha Subkick Bass Drum microphone without even knowing it! That cool bass guitar sound you hear on Paperback Writer and Rain - the first singles released by The Beatles that were recorded by Geoff Emerick - was brought about at Abbey Road by this man! All that weird backwards stuff and the cool sounds that they came up in the studio - especially on Revolver and Pepper - can be attributed to the dedication, hard work, and aesthetic inventiveness of Mr. Emerick. We owe him a great debt!... I would love to work with this man.<br /><br />I loved this book! I mean, I literally ate it up like a ripe avocado! It was juicy and tasty and highly nutritious. If you love The Beatles like I love The Beatles, you\\'re going to love this book. The fact that it focuses on HOW their sound was created is even more enjoyable to a person like me. I could care less what color shirt John Lennon is wearing or what he and Yoko were up to while the other Beatles were starting to record the Abbey Road album. What I really care about is exactly WHAT was going on in the STUDIO when they were recording their music and HOW it all came about. If you\\'re like me, this is the book for you! It\\'s all there - down to who was holding what pencil on what tape machine to line the recorders up for those special songs we all know and love that we have heard on the radio countless times since they were first released. I mean, this is the holy grail. We\\'ve all read books and books about The Beatles over the years, but this is the first - if not the only - one that takes you right there into the studio and behind the control room glass and reveals EXACTLY what was going on and HOW it was recorded. It\\'s amazing and excitingly satisfying - to say the least - for anyone interested in knowing the way that The Beatles went about creating and recording their music. Masterful!<br /><br />I love what Mr. Emerick wrote here on page 117:<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"I\\'m not a huge fan of any of the Beatles CD releases - their songs were recorded with the intention of being released on vinyl, and as far as I am concerned, that is the way they should be heard. But the \\\\\\\\\"Paperback Writer\\\\\\\\\" / \\\\\\\\\"Rain\\\\\\\\\" single sounds exceptionally good on vinyl, not the least of which because Tony Clark was able to use a brand-new piece of gear when mastering it - a huge monstrosity developed by our maintenance department that had blinking lights everywhere. It was called \\\\\\\\\"ATOC,\\\\\\\\\" short for \\\\\\\\\"Automatic Transient Overload Control,\\\\\\\\\" and it allowed for the record to be cut louder than any other single up to that time. Unfortunately, the stereo mix of \\\\\\\\\"Paperback Writer\\\\\\\\\" does the song no justice. It\\'s completely disjointed, and it isn\\'t at all the balance that we intended. To me, the mono mix is much more exciting.<br /><br />Another distinctive aspect of \\\\\\\\\"Paperback Writer\\\\\\\\\" is the fluttering echo at the end of each chorus, added at the mix stage. It was accomplished by routing the vocals into a separate two-track machine and then connecting that machine\\'s output to its input. At the end of each chorus, Phil had the job of slowly increasing the record level until it just reached the point of feedback. If he went one notch too far, the echo would get out of control, so there were many attempts at doing the mix. Every time he\\'d go past that point, or not far enough, we\\'d have to stop and remix the entire song again. That\\'s because, in the archaic EMI way of thinking, edits were frowned upon. Management didn\\'t want anyone taking a razor to master tapes, so multitrack editing - which would allow us to join the start of one take onto the end of another - was rarely allowed in those days. Even during mixing, editing was discouraged, although it would have allowed us to create a mix in sections - something that was commonly done in most other recording studios. Somehow EMI just didn\\'t care what was going on in the outside world: we\\'d have to get the mix right from the start to finish. If we messed up in the middle, or even if the very end of the fadeout wasn\\'t quite right, we would have to start all over again; we couldn\\'t just edit in a replacement for a bad bit. As a result, you got that adrenaline going, and the mixes themselves became performances.<br /> We may have had to do things the hard way, but it also meant we had to put in the effort to get it right. Looking at it that way always made me feel a bit better about the long hours involved.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />See what I mean? ... Geoff and his co-workers took pains in every respect, day after day, year after year, to get it right. The Beatles\\' music benefitted by this, for sure. ... Now as for music on CD, or analog versus digital, or PCM versus 1-Bitstream, or even Mono versus Stereo for that matter, it still boggles me to this day why The Beatles did not insist upon EMI and Parlophone and Capitol Records to release their recently re-mastered recordings just like Neil Young did - in 4 formats: on vinyl, on CD (44.1 kHz / 16 Bit), on DVD (96 kHz / 24 BIT), and on Blu-ray (192 kHz / 24 Bit). I mean, this is The Beatles - the greatest band in the world. If you\\'re going to re-master and re-release all of their music to the world, then you should release it in the highest form of audiophile quality available. As for Mono verses Stereo, I agree with Mr. Emerick - the MONO releases (Get that little White Box while they last!) - are the ones intended to be heard. Those were the mixes that were considered the state-of-the-art, quintessential, archetypal Beatle records for people to hear. Stereo is cool - and we all love it (I love Surround Sound even more!) - but The Beatles music was originally meant to released in MONO - and so that is the way they should be heard, at least up till The White Album. As for analog versus digital, I think if you heard The Beatles on Blu-ray - in Mono OR in Stereo - it would blow your mind! So, why not do it? They\\'ve already re-mastered all of the music at 192 kHz / 24 Bit, so why not let us hear it that way, instead of listening to the, obviously, inferior sonic quality of CD\\'s, with their limited dynamic range and lower sampling rate that means the detail and high end is not captured as close to the original, analog masters as could be with Blu-ray? ... Come on, you guys! ... It\\'s The Beatles for God\\'s sake!<br /><br />I could quote so many great lines and passages from this book about The Beatles, it\\'s not funny! I took 15 pages worth of notes, with 378 separate entries - and I am really tempted to go on and make this review even longer than usual (because you know me, I like to write and could go on forever), but I will leave you with this very touching and heartfelt passage of Mr. Emerick\\'s from page 369 at the end of the book - and you\\'ll have to read the whole book yourself to get to all of the really good stuff that is here on, literally, every page:<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"I still love the art of recording just as much as I did when I was a teenager, but the process is simply not as much fun as it was in those days. Then, it took a team of people to get the sounds right and play the parts correctly. But walk into any studio now and all you\\'ll see is someone staring at a computer screen, moving a mouse, cutting, copying, and pasting as if they were doing a spreadsheet: everything is just too clinical. The Beatles were constantly in search of perfection, it\\'s true, but they were looking for the perfect way to convey a feeling, not technical perfection, which seems to be the goal of many of today\\'s records. If someone made a tiny mistake or sang something a little funny in a Beatles session, it would generally be left in if it was felt it added to the character of the record. Sometimes we\\'d even accentuate the mistakes during mixing, just to underline the fact that the music was being made by fallible beings. Today, there\\'s plenty of technology, but precious little soul.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />BRAVO!, Mr. Emerick! I could not agree more, which is one reason why I do not record my music using computer recording software and a computer monitor. Though I no longer use my good old 4-track analog magnetic tape recorder and use a digital multi-track recorder instead, I do not use a computer. Music was meant to be heard, not seen - which is one reason why a lot of these recording sessions at Abbey Road were done late at night, with minimal light, maybe the glow of a lava lamp and the mixing board level lights while The Beatles were out in the studio in almost complete darkness. ... You need to close your eyes and FEEL the music - really HEAR the music - in order to heighten your sense of hearing, because your sense of sight will get in the way! Staring hypnotically and intently at the simulation of wave forms of beats per second on a computer monitor is not my idea of the best way to work with sound. Ever notice how many great musicians close their eyes when they are in a passionate moment of expression? It enhances their performance.<br /><br />Geoff Emerick knows this. The Beatles knew this. And the best musicians in the world know this. You need to FEEL the music and hear it with your whole body - not just with your eyes! ... God bless Geoff Emerick for his golden ears, his warm heart, his keen mind, and his true sense of musicianship. May people with the same attitude and outlook toward music as him be the ones to pick up the torch and carry it forth into the future of recorded sound! ...

... it\\'s the beatles for god\\'s sake!<br /><br />i could quote so many great lines and passages from this book about the beatles, it\\'s not funny! i took 15 pages worth of notes, with 378 separate entries - and i am really tempted to go on and make this review even longer than usual (because you know me, i like to write and could go on forever), but i will leave you with this very touching and heartfelt passage of mr. emerick\\'s from page 369 at the end of the book - and you\\'ll have to read the whole book yourself to get to all of the really good stuff that is here on, literally, every page:<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"i still love the art of recording just as much as i did when i was a teenager, but the process is simply not as much fun as it was in those days. then, it took a team of people to get the sounds right and play the parts correctly. but walk into any studio now and all you\\'ll see is someone staring at a computer screen, moving a mouse, cutting, copying, and pasting as if they were doing a spreadsheet: everything is just too clinical. the beatles were constantly in search of perfection, it\\'s true, but they were looking for the perfect way to convey a feeling, not technical perfection, which seems to be the goal of many of today\\'s records. if someone made a tiny mistake or sang something a little funny in a beatles session, it would generally be left in if it was felt it added to the character of the record. sometimes we\\'d even accentuate the mistakes during mixing, just to underline the fact that the music was being made by fallible beings. today, there\\'s plenty of technology, but precious little soul.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />bravo!, mr. emerick! i could not agree more, which is one reason why i do not record my music using computer recording software and a computer monitor. though i no longer use my good old 4-track analog magnetic tape recorder and use a digital multi-track recorder instead, i do not use a computer. music was meant to be heard, not seen - which is one reason why a lot of these recording sessions at abbey road were done late at night, with minimal light, maybe the glow of a lava lamp and the mixing board level lights while the beatles were out in the studio in almost complete darkness. ... you need to close your eyes and feel the music - really hear the music - in order to heighten your sense of hearing, because your sense of sight will get in the way! staring hypnotically and intently at the simulation of wave forms of beats per second on a computer monitor is not my idea of the best way to work with sound. ever notice how many great musicians close their eyes when they are in a passionate moment of expression? it enhances their performance.<br /><br />geoff emerick knows this. the beatles knew this. and the best musicians in the world know this. you need to feel the music and hear it with your whole body - not just with your eyes! ... god bless geoff emerick for his golden ears, his warm heart, his keen mind, and his true sense of musicianship. may people with the same attitude and outlook toward music as him be the ones to pick up the torch and carry it forth into the future of recorded sound!

       "       'As a lay person wanting to get informed on the history, the victims, the research and researchers, the politics, the science, and the oncology behind this truly remarkable disease, I could not have picked a better book. Quite an amazing feat of presenting information in such a lucid and well-organized manner. What enhances the appeal of the book is the style of writing. It manages to achieve the fine balance between keeping it accessible for the lay reader and providing sufficient detail. This means that you can keep returning to the book for details that you may otherwise gloss over in your first reading.<br /><br />This is literally a biography of cancer. It is also a commentary on the treatments pursued over the millennia, and of the people who have spent their lives in pursuing a treatment, a cure of the disease. It is also an account of the people, outside the medical profession, who battled against cancer, by raising public awareness and leading campaigns to channel government funding into the research of the disease, to encouraging speedier trials of drugs and treatments that could then be rolled out to wider swathe of patients. This book also looks at the causes of cancer, from its genetic origins, to the factors that precipitate and increase the chances of cancer erupting in a human\\'s body - carcinogens, among whom tobacco is perhaps the most famous of all.<br /><br />Cancer is perhaps the oldest disease to have killed man. A jawbone, dating back to 4000 BC, has signs of a \\\\\\\\\"particular type of lymphoma\\\\\\\\\", a cancer in the lymphatic cells. Six thousand years ago. Imhotep, the Egyptian physician, who lived in the 27th century BC,who made notes on diseases he encountered in patients, fell \\\\\\\\\"atypically silent\\\\\\\\\" with case number forty-five.<br /><br />  || But with case forty-five, Imhotep fell atypically silent. Under the section titled \\\\\\\\\"Therapy,\\\\\\\\\" he offered only a single sentence: \\\\\\\\\"There is none.\\\\\\\\\"...<br /><br />As you read the book, you learn that people have written about this affliction for the longest time. The ancient Greek physician, Claudius Galen, writing almost two thousand years ago, was more right about the nature of cancer than was realized through most of the twentieth century as science made progress into the roots of cancer. The theory of \\\\\\\\\"black bile\\\\\\\\\" may not be very scientific sounding, but as the book progresses the author makes it clear that the nature of cancer is not dissimilar to this theory of black bile - it was not enough to simply remove the afflicted part of the body to rid it of cancer. Cancer had a way of flowing from the diseased portion to other parts of the body, much like the bile that Galen had described.<br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"The human body, Hippocrates proposed, was composed of four cardinal fluids called humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"Galen proposed that cancer was \\\\\\\\\"trapped\\\\\\\\\" black bile--static bile unable to escape from a site and thus congealed into a matted mass.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"The problem with treating cancer surgically, Galen suggested, was that black bile was everywhere, as inevitable and pervasive as any fluid. You could cut cancer out, but the bile would flow right back, like sap seeping through the limbs of a tree.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"The surgical removal of tumors--a local solution to a systemic problem--was thus perceived as a fool\\'s operation.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"But he had uncannily captured something essential about cancer in his dreamy and visceral metaphor. Cancer was often a humoral disease. Crablike and constantly mobile, it could burrow through invisible channels from one organ to another. It was a \\\\\\\\\"systemic\\\\\\\\\" illness, just as Galen had once made it out to be.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br /><br />By so describing cancer, and making it out into an incurable disease, for which no procedure or operation was likely to have any effect, Galen did a huge favor to the victims of cancer that were to follow in the coming centuries.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"Unwittingly, Galen may actually have done the future victims of cancer a favor--at least a temporary one. In the absence of anesthesia and antibiotics, most surgical operations performed in the dank chamber of a medieval clinic--or more typically in the back room of a barbershop with a rusty knife and leather straps for restraints--were disastrous, life-threatening affairs.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />By the time we near the beginning of the twentieth century, the theory that cancer was actually a disease marked, more by anything else, by uncontrolled cell division, had started to take shape. As the century progressed, vaccinations, sterilization of surgical tools, and improved sanitation conditions meant that deaths because of other diseases declined, and cancer began to emerge as a killer in its own right, jostling to claim top spot as the world\\'s foremost killer.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"Between 1900 and 1916, cancer-related mortality grew by 29.8 percent, edging out tuberculosis as a cause of death. By 1926, cancer had become the nation\\'s second most common killer, just behind heart disease.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"By the early twentieth century, many locally restricted cancers (i.e., primary tumors without metastatic lesions) could be removed by surgery. These included uterine and ovarian cancer, breast and prostate cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. If these tumors were removed before they had invaded other organs, these operations produced cures in a significant fraction of patients.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />When science stumbled on chemotherapy as a cure for cancer, and even though it took oncology several years to realize that chemotherapy offered a fairly relapse-free cure for cancer, cancer chose to dig deep to survive, away from the treatment. Deep inside the human body itself.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"Not until several years later did it strike the board that had fired Li so hastily that the patients he had treated with the prolonged maintenance strategy would never relapse. This strategy--which cost Min Chiu Li his job--resulted in the first chemotherapeutic cure of cancer in adults.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"The brain and spinal cord are insulated by a tight cellular seal called the blood-brain barrier that prevents foreign chemicals from easily getting into the brain\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ....<br />  \\\\\\\\\"The next regimen they would try would be a combination of all four drugs: vincristine, amethopterin, mercaptopurine, and prednisone. The regimen would be known by a new acronym, with each letter standing for one of the drugs: VAMP.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"But the same system had likely also kept VAMP out of the nervous system, creating a natural \\\\\\\\\"sanctuary\\\\\\\\\" for cancer within the body. The leukemia, sensing an opportunity in that sanctuary, had furtively climbed in, colonizing the one place that is fundamentally unreachable by chemotherapy [bold emphasis mine]. The children died one after the other--felled by virtue of the adaptation designed to protect them.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />Chemotherapy was only one way of treating cancer. Cancer is incredibly varied. The treatment of cancer demanded a similar amount of flexibility, a realization that came only with the passage of time.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"Cancers possessed temperaments, personalities--behaviors. And biological heterogeneity demanded therapeutic heterogeneity; the same treatment could not indiscriminately be applied to all. But even if Kaplan understood it fully in 1963 and made an example of it in treating Hodgkin\\'s disease, it would take decades for a generation of oncologists to come to the same realization.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"As DeVita charged ahead with combination chemotherapy, more complex and novel devastations were revealed. Chemotherapy caused permanent sterility in men and some women. The annihilation of the immune system by the cytotoxic drugs allowed peculiar infections to sprout up:\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />Tobacco has long been linked to cancer, even though the tobacco industry spent huge sums of money over decades and decades in denying any such links. Apart from outright denial of any causal link between smoking and cancer, suppressing and discrediting research that established such links, the tobacco industry has had access to a vast arsenal of weapons of mass obfuscation. The author is rightly indignant when he outlines just some of these vile tactics employed by the tobacco industry.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"...By the early 1950s, though, cigarette ads, and cigarette brands, were being \\\\\\\\\"designed\\\\\\\\\" for segmented groups: urban workers, housewives, women, immigrants, African-Americans--and, to preemptively bell the medical cat--doctors themselves.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />In 1964, the FTC proposed stamping a warning message on all cigarette packages that struck a cold stab of fear through the tobacco industry.<br />This was the warning label proposed by the FTC:<br /><br />  \\\\\\\\\"Caution: Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Health. It May Cause Death from Cancer and Other Diseases.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />The response of the tobacco industry? Equally cold and calculating. They \\\\\\\\\"voluntarily requested regulation by Congress\\\\\\\\\". Why? Because tobacco was the economic lifeline of several Southern states, \\\\\\\\\"Congress, it was well-known, would inherently be more sympathetic to the interests of tobacco makers.\\\\\\\\\" because \\\\\\\\\"the industry had bribed politicians and funded campaigns so extensively...\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />As a result, the the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) of 196 changed \\\\\\\\\"the FTC\\'s warning label to Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />  \\\\\\\\\"The dire, potent language of the original label--most notably the words cancer, cause, and death--was expunged. To ensure uniformity, state laws were also enfolded into the FCLAA--in effect, ensuring that no stronger warning label could exist in any state in America.<br />  ...<br />  Politicians were far more protective of the narrow interests of tobacco than of the broad interest of public health. \\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />But this naked dance of deception does not end here. The tobacco industry was ready to concede as a smokescreen, practically meaningless concessions in return for tangible gains.<br /><br />  \\\\\\\\\"In late 1970, faced with the daily brunt of negative publicity, tobacco makers voluntarily withdrew cigarette advertising from broadcast media\\\\\\\\\"<br />  \\\\\\\\\"...beleaguered in America, the Marlboro Man has simply sought out new Marlboro countries.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"Tobacco smoking is now a major preventable cause of death in both India and China.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"In a perverse recapitulation of the FCLAA \\\\\\\\\"warning labels act\\\\\\\\\" of the 1970s, in fact, the agreement likely creates yet another safe harbor for the tobacco industry. By granting relative protection from future legal action, by restricting cigarette advertising, and by allowing its signatory companies to fix prices, the agreement provides a virtual monopoly to the companies that have signed the MSA.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"It remains an astonishing, disturbing fact that in America--a nation where nearly every new drug is subjected to rigorous scrutiny as a potential carcinogen, and even the bare hint of a substance\\'s link to cancer ignites a firestorm of public hysteria and media anxiety--one of the most potent and common carcinogens known to humans can be freely bought and sold at every corner store for a few dollars.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest insight at a high level that has emerged recently is that cancer is \\\\\\\\\"not merely genetic in its origins; it was genetic in its entirety\\\\\\\\\".<br /><br />  \\\\\\\\\"Cancer, in short, was not merely genetic in its origin; it was genetic in its entirety. Abnormal genes governed all aspects of cancer\\'s behavior. Cascades of aberrant signals, originating in mutant genes, fanned out within the cancer cell, promoting survival, accelerating growth, enabling mobility, recruiting blood vessels, enhancing nourishment, drawing oxygen--sustaining cancer\\'s life. These gene cascades, notably, were perversions of signaling pathways used by the body under normal circumstances. The \\\\\\\\\"motility genes\\\\\\\\\" activated by cancer cells, for instance, are the very genes that normal cells use when they require movement through the body, such as when immunological cells need to move toward sites of infection. Tumor angiogenesis exploits the same pathways that are used when blood vessels are created to heal wounds. Nothing is invented; nothing is extraneous. Cancer\\'s life is a recapitulation of the body\\'s life, its existence a pathological mirror of our own.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />That cancer is a stubborn affliction is not new. It is only in recent times that we have truly begun to understood the extent to which cancer can mutate and adapt, using the body\\'s intrinsic defense mechanisms against itself.<br /><br />  \\\\\\\\\"... these two traditional Achilles\\' heels of cancer--local growth and rapid cell division--can only be targeted to a point. Surgery and radiation are intrinsically localized strategies, and they fail when cancer cells have spread beyond the limits of what can be surgically removed or irradiated. More surgery thus does not lead to more cures, as the radical surgeons discovered to their despair in the 1950s.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"In the era of nontargeted drugs, cancer cells were known to become drug-resistant through a variety of ingenious mechanisms. Some cells acquire mutations that activate molecular pumps. In normal cells, these pumps extrude natural poisons and waste products from a cell\\'s interior. In cancer cells, these activated pumps push chemotherapy drugs out from the interior of the cell. Spared by chemotherapy, the drug-resistant cells outgrow other cancer cells. Other cancer cells activate proteins that destroy or neutralize drugs. Yet other cancers escape drugs by migrating into reservoirs of the body where drugs cannot penetrate--as in lymphoblastic leukemia relapsing in the brain.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />In closing, the author\\'s vision of how treatment of cancer may look like four decades hence centers mostly on the assumption that we would have understood enough of the genetic foundations of cancer to allow medicine to formulate cures based on this knowledge. Such a cure will be based on a combination of targeted surgery, gene mapping to formulate a cocktail of drugs to \\\\\\\\\"prevent, cure, or palliate the illness\\\\\\\\\", lasting the the life of the patient.

This was the warning label proposed by the FTC:        \\\\\\\\\"Caution: Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Health. It May Cause Death from Cancer and Other Diseases.\\\\\\\\\"    The response of the tobacco industry? Equally cold and calculating. They \\\\\\\\\"voluntarily requested regulation by Congress\\\\\\\\\". Why? Because tobacco was the economic lifeline of several Southern states, \\\\\\\\\"Congress, it was well-known, would inherently be more sympathetic to the interests of tobacco makers.\\\\\\\\\" because \\\\\\\\\"the industry had bribed politicians and funded campaigns so extensively...\\\\\\\\\"    As a result, the the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) of 196 changed \\\\\\\\\"the FTC\\'s warning label to Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.\\\\\\\\\"        \\\\\\\\\"The dire, potent language of the original label--most notably the words cancer, cause, and death--was expunged.

       "       'as a lay person wanting to get informed on the history, the victims, the research and researchers, the politics, the science, and the oncology behind this truly remarkable disease, i could not have picked a better book. quite an amazing feat of presenting information in such a lucid and well-organized manner. what enhances the appeal of the book is the style of writing. it manages to achieve the fine balance between keeping it accessible for the lay reader and providing sufficient detail. this means that you can keep returning to the book for details that you may otherwise gloss over in your first reading.<br /><br />this is literally a biography of cancer. it is also a commentary on the treatments pursued over the millennia, and of the people who have spent their lives in pursuing a treatment, a cure of the disease. it is also an account of the people, outside the medical profession, who battled against cancer, by raising public awareness and leading campaigns to channel government funding into the research of the disease, to encouraging speedier trials of drugs and treatments that could then be rolled out to wider swathe of patients. this book also looks at the causes of cancer, from its genetic origins, to the factors that precipitate and increase the chances of cancer erupting in a human\\'s body - carcinogens, among whom tobacco is perhaps the most famous of all.<br /><br />cancer is perhaps the oldest disease to have killed man. a jawbone, dating back to 4000 bc, has signs of a \\\\\\\\\"particular type of lymphoma\\\\\\\\\", a cancer in the lymphatic cells. six thousand years ago. imhotep, the egyptian physician, who lived in the 27th century bc,who made notes on diseases he encountered in patients, fell \\\\\\\\\"atypically silent\\\\\\\\\" with case number forty-five.<br /><br />  || but with case forty-five, imhotep fell atypically silent. under the section titled \\\\\\\\\"therapy,\\\\\\\\\" he offered only a single sentence: \\\\\\\\\"there is none.\\\\\\\\\"...<br /><br />as you read the book, you learn that people have written about this affliction for the longest time. the ancient greek physician, claudius galen, writing almost two thousand years ago, was more right about the nature of cancer than was realized through most of the twentieth century as science made progress into the roots of cancer. the theory of \\\\\\\\\"black bile\\\\\\\\\" may not be very scientific sounding, but as the book progresses the author makes it clear that the nature of cancer is not dissimilar to this theory of black bile - it was not enough to simply remove the afflicted part of the body to rid it of cancer. cancer had a way of flowing from the diseased portion to other parts of the body, much like the bile that galen had described.<br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"the human body, hippocrates proposed, was composed of four cardinal fluids called humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"galen proposed that cancer was \\\\\\\\\"trapped\\\\\\\\\" black bile--static bile unable to escape from a site and thus congealed into a matted mass.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"the problem with treating cancer surgically, galen suggested, was that black bile was everywhere, as inevitable and pervasive as any fluid. you could cut cancer out, but the bile would flow right back, like sap seeping through the limbs of a tree.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"the surgical removal of tumors--a local solution to a systemic problem--was thus perceived as a fool\\'s operation.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"but he had uncannily captured something essential about cancer in his dreamy and visceral metaphor. cancer was often a humoral disease. crablike and constantly mobile, it could burrow through invisible channels from one organ to another. it was a \\\\\\\\\"systemic\\\\\\\\\" illness, just as galen had once made it out to be.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br /><br />by so describing cancer, and making it out into an incurable disease, for which no procedure or operation was likely to have any effect, galen did a huge favor to the victims of cancer that were to follow in the coming centuries.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"unwittingly, galen may actually have done the future victims of cancer a favor--at least a temporary one. in the absence of anesthesia and antibiotics, most surgical operations performed in the dank chamber of a medieval clinic--or more typically in the back room of a barbershop with a rusty knife and leather straps for restraints--were disastrous, life-threatening affairs.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />by the time we near the beginning of the twentieth century, the theory that cancer was actually a disease marked, more by anything else, by uncontrolled cell division, had started to take shape. as the century progressed, vaccinations, sterilization of surgical tools, and improved sanitation conditions meant that deaths because of other diseases declined, and cancer began to emerge as a killer in its own right, jostling to claim top spot as the world\\'s foremost killer.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"between 1900 and 1916, cancer-related mortality grew by 29.8 percent, edging out tuberculosis as a cause of death. by 1926, cancer had become the nation\\'s second most common killer, just behind heart disease.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"by the early twentieth century, many locally restricted cancers (i.e., primary tumors without metastatic lesions) could be removed by surgery. these included uterine and ovarian cancer, breast and prostate cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. if these tumors were removed before they had invaded other organs, these operations produced cures in a significant fraction of patients.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />when science stumbled on chemotherapy as a cure for cancer, and even though it took oncology several years to realize that chemotherapy offered a fairly relapse-free cure for cancer, cancer chose to dig deep to survive, away from the treatment. deep inside the human body itself.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"not until several years later did it strike the board that had fired li so hastily that the patients he had treated with the prolonged maintenance strategy would never relapse. this strategy--which cost min chiu li his job--resulted in the first chemotherapeutic cure of cancer in adults.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"the brain and spinal cord are insulated by a tight cellular seal called the blood-brain barrier that prevents foreign chemicals from easily getting into the brain\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ....<br />  \\\\\\\\\"the next regimen they would try would be a combination of all four drugs: vincristine, amethopterin, mercaptopurine, and prednisone. the regimen would be known by a new acronym, with each letter standing for one of the drugs: vamp.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"but the same system had likely also kept vamp out of the nervous system, creating a natural \\\\\\\\\"sanctuary\\\\\\\\\" for cancer within the body. the leukemia, sensing an opportunity in that sanctuary, had furtively climbed in, colonizing the one place that is fundamentally unreachable by chemotherapy [bold emphasis mine]. the children died one after the other--felled by virtue of the adaptation designed to protect them.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />chemotherapy was only one way of treating cancer. cancer is incredibly varied. the treatment of cancer demanded a similar amount of flexibility, a realization that came only with the passage of time.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"cancers possessed temperaments, personalities--behaviors. and biological heterogeneity demanded therapeutic heterogeneity; the same treatment could not indiscriminately be applied to all. but even if kaplan understood it fully in 1963 and made an example of it in treating hodgkin\\'s disease, it would take decades for a generation of oncologists to come to the same realization.\\\\\\\\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\\\\\\\\"as devita charged ahead with combination chemotherapy, more complex and novel devastations were revealed. chemotherapy caused permanent sterility in men and some women. the annihilation of the immune system by the cytotoxic drugs allowed peculiar infections to sprout up:\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />tobacco has long been linked to cancer, even though the tobacco industry spent huge sums of money over decades and decades in denying any such links. apart from outright denial of any causal link between smoking and cancer, suppressing and discrediting research that established such links, the tobacco industry has had access to a vast arsenal of weapons of mass obfuscation. the author is rightly indignant when he outlines just some of these vile tactics employed by the tobacco industry.<br /><br />||<br />  \\\\\\\\\"...by the early 1950s, though, cigarette
